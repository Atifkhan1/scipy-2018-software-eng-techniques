# Software Engineering Techniques at SciPy 2018: Data Project

## Format

We will be working between text files and the command line. **Please make sure you have followed
the setup instructions prior to starting the course.** See instructions [here](https://github.com/jiffyclub/scipy-2018-software-eng-techniques#setup-instructions).

## Goals

By the completion of this data project, we expect that you will be able to:

* Load a dataset into your Python module
* Build a series of small functions using Python that allow you to: clean, aggregate, and filter data
* Test your code using pytest
* Debug errors and test failures your Python code
* Understand how to profile and test code for performance
* Learn how to build reusable code
* Understand the benefits of packaging your code for distribution

## Lesson Details

We will be working with Restaurant/Food Inspection data provided by the City of San Francisco. (As
a small side note, various cities in the USA provide interesting data sets!)

In order to explore and gain insights around this dataset, we will build a series of Python functions
that cleanse, aggregate and summarize this data.
